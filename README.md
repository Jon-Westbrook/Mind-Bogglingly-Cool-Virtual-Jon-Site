## Assets

Sweater textures are generated via this library: https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI
and prompts to feed into it can be generated by adjusting `/scripts/generate-prompts.js` and running `npm run prompts`.

After textures are generated, they can be turned into a json file with extra metadata via the `npm run sweaters` command.
